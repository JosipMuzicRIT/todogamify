# TodoGamify app

This is a todo app made in Flutter. It uses Firebase to store its data.

### Running the app (Only works with an Android device)

To run the app locate the .apk file located in `/build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/app-release.apk`
Transfer it to your Android device and install the .apk file.
If you want to run it on your iOS device you need to run it locally with your iOS device plugged in.

### Running it locally

For help getting started with Flutter, view their
[online documentation](https://flutter.dev/docs), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.

After installing flutter you can use `flutter pub get` to install the dependencies.
To run the app locally you can use `flutter run`.


## File structure

All of my code is located under the `lib` folder. Not many files outside of the `lib` were tampered with, asside from the `pubspec.yaml` file, and the Google Firebase files that I needed to add.
